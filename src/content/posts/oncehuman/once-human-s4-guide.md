# Once Human: Season 4 'The Storm' Endgame Guide

Season 4 is the culmination of the current storyline, bringing an electric-themed threat and the hardest challenges yet.

## ⚡ New Threat: The Electric Storm

Periodic global storms disable all electronic devices, including your base defenses and vehicles. This requires players to focus on manual defense during the storm.

## 🛡️ Endgame Gear: Plasma Tier

* **Weapon:** The **Arc-Cannon**, a slow but devastating electric-damage weapon.
* **Armor:** **The Aegis Suit**, which provides near-total immunity to electric damage.

The seasonal final objective is the **Destruction of the Central Nexus**, requiring a full squad and the strongest gear from all previous seasons.
