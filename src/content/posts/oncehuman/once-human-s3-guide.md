# Once Human: Season 3 'The Scorched Earth' Tactics

Season 3 takes the fight to the arid desert, introducing high-damage fire-based enemies and a new environmental threat.

## 🔥 Environmental Hazard: Heatstroke

Wearing heavy armor is now a liability. You must use **Cooling Packs** and light armor sets to manage your internal temperature. Base defense requires water-based turrets.

## 🚁 New PvE Content: Supply Drops

Timed airborne supply drops occur randomly. Securing these drops is the fastest way to obtain **Scorched Core Materials** required for the new T5 equipment. Be prepared for heavy PvP competition around the drop zones.
