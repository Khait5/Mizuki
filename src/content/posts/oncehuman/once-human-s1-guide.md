# Once Human: Season 1 'The Awakening' Comprehensive Guide

Season 1, "The Awakening," sets the tone for the world after the collapse. This season focuses on survival and establishing a foothold.

## 🗺️ New Zone: The Gloomwood Forest

* **Threat Level:** Moderate
* **Key Resource:** Gloom-Weave Fiber, essential for the new Tier 3 armor sets.
* **New Enemy:** The **Stalker Hounds**, fast-moving creatures that hunt in packs and apply a crippling 'Gloom' debuff.

## 🏗️ Base Building & Defense

The main focus is the **Netherspark Generator**. You must build a secure base and defend the generator from nightly waves of the **Deviant** enemies, which are stronger and more numerous than standard enemies. Upgrading the generator is the path to season completion.
