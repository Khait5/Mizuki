# BDO 2025 Fishing Guide: Master the Waters

Fishing is a great passive life skill in Black Desert Online, perfect for AFK time. Here's how to master it in 2025.

## 🎣 Getting Started

You only need a fishing rod to start. Basic rods can be purchased from a **Material Vendor** or **Fisher**. For better results, look into more advanced rods like the **Triple Float Rod** (for active fishing) or the **Balenos Fishing Rod** (for AFK fishing).

## 🗺️ Hotspots and Rare Fish

* **Velia Hotspot:** Near Velia, often spawns when many players are fishing. Look for the massive flock of seagulls!
* **Margoria and Ross Sea:** Requires a boat and higher investment, but offers the most valuable fish for trade.
* **River/Freshwater Fishing:** Offers fewer valuable fish but can be a good source of trash items for material exchange.

## 💰 Passive Income (AFK Fishing)

For AFK fishing, the **Balenos Fishing Rod** is highly recommended because its durability consumption decreases as its enhancement level increases.

1.  **Get a +10 Balenos Fishing Rod.**
2.  **Equip a Penguin or Polar Bear pet** to decrease your auto-fishing time.
3.  **Find a safe spot** in a town or secure fishing area.
4.  **Open your inventory, right-click the rod, and wait!**
