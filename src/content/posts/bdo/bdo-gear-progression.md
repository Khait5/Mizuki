# BDO 2025 Gear Progression Guide: From Narchillan to Godr-Ayed

This guide outlines the optimal gear progression path for new and returning adventurers in 2025.

## 🛡️ Stage 1: The Beginner Sets

### Narchillan & PEN Tuvala
Your first major goal is to secure the **Narchillan Gear** (obtained via a questline) and upgrade your seasonal **Tuvala Gear** to **PEN (V)**. This set provides high base stats and is a prerequisite for the next stages.

## 🗡️ Stage 2: Boss Gear and Accessories

After graduation, you convert your PEN Tuvala to **TET (IV) Boss Gear** (e.g., Dim Tree Spirit's Armor) and start enhancing the coveted **TET Blackstar** or **Godr-Ayed** weapons.

| Slot        | Transition Goal | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Main Weapon | TET Blackstar   | Great for PvE. Avoid enhancement until you're ready for PEN. |
| Armor       | TET Boss Gear   | Upgrade to PEN later, or directly to Fallen God. |
| Accessories | PEN Capotia / TET Distortion | Focus on Capotia for cost efficiency. |

## 🌟 Stage 3: Endgame Gear (Fallen God & PEN Blackstar)

This stage involves acquiring the highest tier gear:

* **Fallen God Armor:** Enhanced from PEN Dim Tree or Red Nose Armor.
* **PEN Blackstar Weapons/Godr-Ayed:** Your ultimate PvE/PvP weapons.
