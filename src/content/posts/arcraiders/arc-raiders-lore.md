# Arc Raiders: Understanding the Lore and Factions

The world of Arc Raiders is one of desperation and constant threat.

## 🤖 The ARC

The ARC is a mysterious, relentless mechanical threat that rained down from space, destroying Earth's civilization. They are not mindless machines; they appear to follow a complex, devastating logic, systematically dismantling all human infrastructure.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The Raiders

You are a Raider, one of the last few organized resistance fighters. Operating out of the hidden underground safe-zone of **The Hub**, Raiders risk their lives to gather the resources needed to fight back and one day, maybe, reclaim the surface.

The main human faction is the **Retriever Corps**, the organization that funds and coordinates the extraction missions. Failures, however, are met with extreme prejudice.
