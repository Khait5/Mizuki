# Arc Raiders: Free Loadout

So, are you playing arc raiders and you got deleted in the last lobby and now you ran out of weapons, materials and everything, so, what to do now?

Arc Raiders itself has a "free loadout" mechanic, similar to SCAV in Escape from Tarkov, basically its a free random loadout that you can use during the lobby, it gives you a gray weapon, ammo for that weapon and few basic utilities as bandages or shield recovery, plus a basic bag and shield.

That sounds fine but it's actually way more important than EFT's SCAV, because **you can use it without limits**, now we're talking.

"So, I can receive free weapon+ammo+utilities+shield+bag an unlimited amount of times?" Yes. And this is why its actually so op on this game, but it has a nonwritten limit -> your stash space; but thats obvious, you cant use free loadout if your stash has no free space to move your stuff in your inventory, right?



## When to use free loadout.

*  **You just died.** Simple, you lost everything so you have empty inventory to use a free loadout to get in and loot, you wont lose anything if you die again.
*  **Dangerous quest.** A quest ask you 7 different steps that has to be done in same round in a 5/5 difficulty map? Free loadout and stalk in. This also work for quest in general.
*  **Worried to lose actual gear.** If you don't have any unriskable gear, use free loadout.

## When to NOT use free loadout.


* **Queen Lobbies:** XD just don't.
* **Queuing UP** Don't queue to get into a party to make people carry your ass. Unless they are your friends, then it's okay.
* **Stash Full** If your stash is full and you can wear similar stuff as free loadout from your stash, just dont sell stuff to free space to have free loadout, its not worth it, you wont lose anything anyway it's free stuff.
