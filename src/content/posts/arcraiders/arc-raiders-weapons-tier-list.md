# Arc Raiders: Early Access Weapons Tier List

## S-Tier: Dominating the ARC

| Weapon Name | Primary Role | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **"The Devastator"** | Anti-Armor | Massive area-of-effect damage, perfect for clearing tight groups of ARC Drones. |
| **"Nightingale"** | Support/Heal | A specialized weapon that can also fire healing projectiles at teammates. Essential for high-difficulty raids. |

## A-Tier: Strong and Reliable

* **Thunderbolt Sniper:** High single-target damage, excellent for taking out key components on larger ARC enemies.
* **Pulse Rifle:** The most versatile mid-range weapon, reliable damage and high rate of fire.

## B-Tier: Situationally Effective

* **Rattlesnake SMG:** Great up-close, but runs out of ammo too quickly against large bosses.
* **Sawtooth Shotgun:** Only useful in extreme close-quarters; highly risky in open areas.
