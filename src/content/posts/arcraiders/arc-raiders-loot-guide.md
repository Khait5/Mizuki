# Arc Raiders: Important Loot vs. Recycling Trash

Loot management is crucial in an extraction shooter. Knowing what to keep and what to recycle will save you time and maximize your profits.

## ⭐ Keepers (Important Loot)

* **Weapon Mods (Legendary/Epic):** These are game-changers. Look for mods that add extra elemental damage or increase critical hit chance.
* **Blueprints:** Permanent crafting recipes that allow you to bring in better gear on future drops.
* **High-Tier Raw Materials (T3 and up):** Needed for crafting your best base gear. Always prioritize **Iridium** and **Synth-Fiber**.
* **Data Drives:** Used for research and unlocking new Raider abilities.

## 🗑️ Recyclables (Trash)

* **Broken/Damaged Weapons:** Unless they are a high-tier blueprint you need to unlock, recycle them immediately for basic components.
* **Common (White) Armor Components:** Once you have a strong inventory, these are low-value and should be recycled for raw materials.
* **Basic Medical Supplies:** Keep a stack of 3-5, but recycle any excess.

## 💡 Quick Identification Tip

When hovering over an item, look for the **golden border** for high-value gear/mods and the **Blueprint Icon** for permanent unlocks. If it doesn't have a special icon, it's likely a consumable or a recycle candidate.
