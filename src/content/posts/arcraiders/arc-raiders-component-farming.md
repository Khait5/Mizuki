# Arc Raiders: Efficient Component Farming Routes

This guide focuses on the best areas on the map to farm crucial high-tier components without running into the main ARC swarm.

## 1. The Obsidian Peaks (T3 Iridium)

* **Zone Risk:** Medium
* **Target:** Mining outposts and collapsed tunnels.
* **Strategy:** Bring explosives. The Iridium nodes are often protected by heavily armored Drones.

## 2. The Sunken City Ruins (T4 Synth-Fiber)

* **Zone Risk:** High
* **Target:** Submerged data centers and old research labs.
* **Strategy:** Requires a Raider with high mobility (like the Scout). Be prepared to encounter the dreaded **ARC Titans**. The Synth-Fiber is usually found in locked containers.

:::caution
Avoid staying in the zone after the second ARC alarm. The drop rate for high-tier materials decreases, and the enemy difficulty spikes dramatically.
