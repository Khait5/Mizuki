# 🖤 Meet EveBlack: Code & Combat Enthusiast

Welcome! I'm **EveBlack**, a passionate programmer and a dedicated MMORPG player for over **15 years**. This page is a glimpse into my two major worlds: the world of code and the world of high fantasy and intense raids.

## 💻 The Coding Side

While I spend my nights battling dragons and bosses, my days are often dedicated to building, tweaking, and optimizing software. I thrive on challenges, whether it's debugging a tricky piece of logic or figuring out the optimal rotation in a raid. The same focus, patience, and meticulousness required for a perfect boss fight are what I bring to my development work.

## ⚔️ The Gamer Side

My heart belongs to the MMORPG genre. The sense of community, the endless progression, and the thrill of complex combat systems keep me hooked.

### Black Desert Online (BDO)

My main game is **Black Desert Online**. I'm a committed adventurer who believes in pushing boundaries.

* **Main Class:** Wusa
* **Level:** 65
* **Gear Score (GS):** 800 (and constantly climbing!)

If you see a Wusa tearing up the grind spots, it might just be me!

### Other Adventures

Beyond BDO, I'm eagerly exploring new titles and old favorites:

* **ARC Raiders:** Excited about the intense cooperative shooting and futuristic setting.
* **Once Human:** Looking forward to diving into the new-age survival RPG experience.

## 🧟 Resident Evil Devotee

When I need a break from grinding, I dive headfirst into the world of survival horror, and there is no better franchise than **Resident Evil**. I'm on a mission to 100% all the trophies, though some challenges (like S-ranking) prove... formidable.

Here is a look at my current trophy completion across the main titles and Revelations:
